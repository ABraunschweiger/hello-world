# hello-world
First respository tutorial
I'm never sure what to say about myself, but here goes. I am a student currently trying to find out what it is I am passionate about. I have been practicing HTML, CSS, and Javascipt on Sololearn and on Codeacademy. I want to keep learning and exploring everything I can. I suppose that means I will be a student forever and I like the idea of that.
Hopefully I'll meet some fellow wanderers on my adventures. I look forward to collaborating and learning with all of you.
