  <h2>Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>Hello world and welcome to my GitHub. I am a college student trying to find out where my passions align before I jump into any graduate programs. I have recently had a renewed interest in programming. I have coded using HTML and CSS since the days of Neopets. I designed backgrounds for guild pages as an elementary student on 
<a href=http://www.neopets.com/> Neopets</a>. I am currently practicing various coding skills on <a href=https://www.sololearn.com> Sololearn </a> and on <a href=https://www.codecademy.com/> Codeacademy </a> such as:
<ul>
  <li>HTML
  </li> 
  <li>CSS
  </li> 
  <li>Javascript
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>I want to keep learning and exploring everything I can. I suppose that means I will be a student forever. I am excited to see where coding can take me.
</p>
  <h2>Projects
</h2>
  <p>I will frequently update this page to reflect where I am in the stages of my learning and where I hope to be. Currently I have a few assignments I need to focus on for my coursework at school. When I have some more free time I will continue with my Codeacademy and Sololearn tutorials.
