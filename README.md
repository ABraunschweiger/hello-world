<head>First respository tutorial</head>
<body><p>I'm never sure what to say about myself, but here goes. I am a student currently trying to find out what it is I am passionate about. I have been practicing <ul><li>HTML</li> <li>CSS</li> <li>Javascipt</li></ul> on Sololearn and on Codeacademy. I want to keep learning and exploring everything I can. I suppose that means I will be a student forever and I like the idea of that.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll meet some fellow wanderers on my adventures. I look forward to collaborating and learning with all of you.</p></body>
