  <p>I'm never sure what to say about myself, but here goes.</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hello there and welcome to my GitHub. I am a college student and I am trying to find where my passions align before I jump into a graduate program. I have more recently taken a liking to programming and have been doing light HTML and CSS coding since the days of Neopets' guilds. I designed backgrounds for guild pages on Neopets website and during that time I had no idea what it meant to be able to create them so easily as an elementary student. I have been practicing various coding skills on Sololearn and on Codeacademy such as:
<ul><li>HTML</li> <li>CSS</li> <li>Javascipt</li></ul></p>
<p>I want to keep learning and exploring everything I can. I suppose that means I will be a student forever and I'm excited to see where coding can take me.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll meet some fellow explorers on my adventures. I look forward to collaborating and learning with all of you!</p></body>
